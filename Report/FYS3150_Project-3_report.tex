\section{Introduction}
	Integrals play a huge role in science. Many of the integrals we encounter are possible to evaluate analytically, but a vast sample is not and numerical methods have to be used. Numerical integration is, however, prone to round off errors, especially if the functions which we are evaluating do not behave "nicely". The Newton-Cotes algorithm is a very easy algorithm to implement and understand, however it doesn't produce very reliable results. Supplementing this algorithm, there have been developed a lot of other schemes. In this project, I have implemented Gaussian quadrature with weight functions based on Legendre polynomials and Laguerre polynomials, as well as two Monte Carlo methods to solve a quantum mechanical integral, specifically the quantum mechanical expectation value of the correlation energy between two electrons which repel each other via the classical Coulomb interaction. 
	
	The integral in question can be solved in closed form and its exact value is therefore used in the discussion of the reliability of the different methods.

\section{Theory/Methods}
	\subsection{The Integral}
		The integral we will evaluate is the six-dimensional ground state expectation value of the correlation energy between to electrons in a helium atom. To do this, we assume that each electron can be modelled via the single-particle wave function
		\begin{align}
			\psi_{1s} (\mathbf{r}_i) = e^{-\alpha r_i}
		\end{align}
		where $\alpha$ is a parameter corresponding to the charge of the nucleus around which the electrons are orbiting, the position vector $\mathbf{r}_i$ for electron $i$ is given by
		\begin{align}
			\mathbf{r}_i = x_i \mathbf{e}_x + y_i \mathbf{e}_y + z_i \mathbf{e}_z
		\end{align}
		with magnitude
		\begin{align}
			r_i = \sqrt{x_i^2 + y_i^2 + z_i^2}.
		\end{align}
		
		The wave function for two electrons is then given by
		\begin{align}
			\Psi(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) = \psi(\mathbf{r}_2)\psi(\mathbf{r}_2) = e^{-\alpha(r_1 + r_2)}
		\end{align}
		Note that this is not normalized, however this will only change the integral by a factor equal to the normalization factor, and is not of interest in this project.
		
		The integral which we wish to solve is then
		\begin{align}
			\langle \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|} \rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \d\mathbf{r}_1 \mathbf{r}_2 e^{-2\alpha(r_1+r_2)} \frac{1}{|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2|} \label{eq: unchanged integral}
		\end{align}
		where the differentials $\mathbf{r}_i$ are the volume elements in Cartesian coordinates. The above integral has the closed form answer $5\pi^2/16^2$.
		
		Numerically, the integration limits of $\pm \infty$ are difficult to implement. However, if we make a change of variables to spherical coordinates, we loose 4 out of six infinite integrals.
		In spherical coordinates, the volume elements can be written as
		\begin{align}
			\d\mathbf{r}_i = r_i^2\sin (\theta_i)\d \theta_i \d \phi_i \d r_i
		\end{align}
		where $r_i \in [0, \infty)$, $\theta_i \in [0, \pi]$ and $\phi_i \in [0, 2\pi]$. The magnitude of the distance between the electrons is 
		\begin{align}
			|\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_2| = r_{12} = \sqrt{r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2r_1 r_2 \cos \beta}
		\end{align}
		where
		\begin{align}
			\cos\beta = \cos(\theta_1) \cos (\theta_2) + \sin(\theta_1)\sin(\theta_2) \cos(\phi_1 - \phi_2) \nonumber
		\end{align}
		The integral in spherical coordinates is then
		\begin{align}
			\langle \frac{1}{r_{12}} \rangle = \int \d r_1 \d r_2 \d \theta_1 \d \theta_2 \d \phi_1 \d \phi_2 \frac{1}{r_{12}} r_1^2r_2^2\sin(\theta_1)\sin(\theta_2) e^{-2\alpha(r_1+r_2)}
		\end{align}
		
		Simplifying further, using $u = 2\alpha r_1$ and $v = 2\alpha r_2$ ($u\in [0,\infty$, $v\in [0, \infty)$), we obtain finally
		\begin{align}
			\langle \frac{1}{r_{12}} \rangle = \frac{1}{(2\alpha)^5} \int \d u \d v \d \theta_1 \d \theta_2 \d \phi_1 \d \phi_2 \frac{1}{\sqrt{u^2 + v^2 - 2uv\cos\beta}} u^2v^2\sin(\theta_1)\sin(\theta_2) e^{-u}e^{-v} \label{eq: integral in spherical coordinates, u, v}
		\end{align}
		
	\subsection{Gaussian Quadrature}
		The basic idea behind Gaussian quadrature is to approximate the integral of a function $f$ by
		\begin{align}
			I = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \ \d x  = \int_{a}^{b} W(x)g(x) \ \d x \approx \sum_{i=1}^N w_i g(x_i) \label{eq: gaussian quadrature basic idea}
		\end{align}
		where $W(x)$ is a weight function obtained through a polynomial which is orthogonal in some interval $[a, b]$. Two such weight functions are $W(x)=1$ which uses Legendre polynomials in the interval $x\in[-1, 1]$ and $W(x) = x^\alpha e^{-x}$ which uses the Laguerre polynomials in the interval $x \in [0, \infty)$. 
		
		\subsubsection{The 6-Dimensional Integral}\label{section: the 6-dimensional integral}
			Eq.~\eqref{eq: gaussian quadrature basic idea} shows the formalism for calculating a one-dimensional integral. For a multidimensional integral, it is quite similar, only we need a number of sums equal to the number of dimensions. In a computer program, this is done with $n$ for loops when $n$ is the number of dimensions. For the 6-dimensional case a code snippet could look like
			
			\begin{lstlisting}
double integral = 0;
for (int i=0; i < order; i++) {
		for (int j=0; j < order; j++) {
		for (int k=0; k < order; k++) {
		for (int l=0; l < order; l++) {
		for (int m=0; m < order; m++) {
		for (int n=0; n < order; n++) {
			integral += w_d1[i]*w_d2[j]*w_d3[k]*w_d4[l]*w_d5[m]*w_d6[n]*
						integrand(x_d1[i], x_2[j], x_d3[k], x_d4[l], x_d5[m], x_d6[n]);
		}}}}}
}
			\end{lstlisting}
			where \texttt{w\_di} and \texttt{z\_di} are arrays containing the weights and roots associated with the \texttt{i}-th dimension in the proper interval, and \texttt{integrand} is a function evaluating the integrand for the six dimensions. 
			
		
		\subsubsection{Gauss-Legendre Quadrature}
			As indicated above, the weight function used in Gauss-Legendre Quadrature is $W(x)=1$. The function which we wish to integrate is therefore the same, that is
			\begin{align}
				I = \int_{-1}^{1} f(x) \ \d x \approx \sum_{i=1}^N w_i f(x_i)
			\end{align}
			where $x_i$ are the abscissas  given by the roots of the Legendre polynomial $P_N$ of degree $N$ and $w_i$ are the weights given by
			\begin{align*}
				w_i = \frac{2}{(1-x_i^2)[P'_N(x_i)]^2}
			\end{align*}
			
			For this project, I have developed a code which returns the weights and  abscissas for the Legendre polynomial of degree $N$. The codes can be found in the file \texttt{gaussianquadrature.cpp}. The relevant functions are \texttt{legendreRoots} and \texttt{legendreWeights}.
			
			The function \texttt{legendreRoots} begins with an initial guess for the $i$-th root 
			\begin{align*}
				x_\mathrm{guess} = \cos \left( \pi \frac{4(i+1) - 1}{4N + 2} \right) 
			\end{align*}
			and then approximates the real root using Newtons method. 
			
			
			Note that the direct use of this method will integrate a function in the interval $x\in[-1,1]$. Our function is, however, in the limits $\pm \infty$. We can always change variables from the limits $x \in [a, b]$ to $x \in [-1, 1]$ using
			\begin{align}
				\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \ \d x = \frac{b-a}{2} \int_{-1}^{1} f\left( \frac{b-a}{2}x_i + \frac{b+a}{2} \right) \ \d x
			\end{align}
			which does not help us evaluating the infinite integrals of eq.~\eqref{eq: unchanged integral}. To deal with this problem, note that eq.~\eqref{eq: unchanged integral} involves an exponential on the form $e^{-x}$ which approached 0 quickly. To evaluate the integral using Gauss-Legendre quadrature, the limits $a$ and $b$ are therefore set to a value where $e^{-2\alpha r}$ is more or less zero. Fig.~\ref{fig: integration limits Gauss-Legendre} shows a plot of $e^{-\alpha |x|}$, and by inspection such limits could be set to $\pm 5$. 
			
			Since we are now working in Cartesian coordinates, all directions are weighted the same and we need only make one call to the functions that calculate the roots and weights of the Legendre polynomial, i.e. \texttt{w\_d1}=\texttt{w\_d2}=...=\texttt{w\_d6}=\texttt{w} and similarly  \texttt{x\_d1}=\texttt{x\_d2}=...=\texttt{x\_d6}=\texttt{x} in the code in section~\ref{section: the 6-dimensional integral}. The \texttt{integrand} function is now simply the integrand in eq.~\eqref{eq: unchanged integral}.

				\label{fig: integration limits Gauss-Legendre}
			\end{figure}
		
		
		\subsubsection{Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature}
			Gauss-Laguerre quadrature is somewhat more sophisticated than Gauss-Legendre. In this case, the weight function is given by $x^\alpha e^{-x}$ and the associated polynomial is the Laguerre polynomials which are orthogonal in the interval $x\in [0, \infty)$. Looking back at eq.~\eqref{eq: integral in spherical coordinates, u, v}, we see that this rewriting of the original integral involves factors of the kind $x^\alpha e^{-x}$, and so, using the formalism in eq.~\eqref{eq: gaussian quadrature basic idea}, these factors can be taken out of the integral when we are employing a proper polynomial, namely Laguerre polynomials. The nice thing now, is that the mapping we have made is between 0 and $\infty$, and the need of an approximation is not necessary, as was the case for Gauss-Legendre quadrature.
			
			The angular part of eq.~\eqref{eq: integral in spherical coordinates, u, v} can be integrated using Legendre polynomials, also without limit approximations. 
			
			Since the limits we are now working with change depending on to what dimension in the spherical coordinate system we are integrating over, the weights and roots will also change accordingly. However, we can pair up the dimensions in one radial part (the one which is calculated using Laguerre polynomials), a $\phi$ part and a$\theta$ part. We therefore need to make a function call like
			\begin{lstlisting}
rootsLegendre(N, theta);
weightsLegendre(N, weightsTheta, theta, 0, pi);
rootsLegendre(N, phi);
weightsLegendre(N, weightsPhi, phi, 0, 2*pi);
gauss_laguerre(r, weightsR, N, 2);
			\end{lstlisting}
			
			and then the integrand is simply
			\begin{align}
				\frac{1}{u^2 + v^2 - 2uv \cos\beta} \sin(\theta_1) \sin(\theta_2).
			\end{align}
		
		
	\subsection{Monte Carlo Integration}
		The basic philosophy in Monte Carlo (MC) integration is to uniformly choose a set of points in a given interval $[a, b]$ and calculate the value of the integrand for each random point. We look at each value for the integrand as a bar of width $1/N$, so the integral can the be approximated by
		\begin{align}
			I = \int_{0}^{1} f(x) \ \d x \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_{i-1/2})
		\end{align}
		when a uniform probability distribution function (PDF) ($p(x)=1$) is used. For any other PDF, the integral can be approximated by
		\begin{align}
			I = \int_{0}^{1} f(x) \ \d x \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)p(x_i) = \langle f \rangle 
		\end{align}
		
		The error in the stochastic experiment is given by the variance
		\begin{align}
			\sigma^2 = \langle f^2 \rangle - \langle f \rangle ^2
		\end{align}
		
		
		
				 
		\subsubsection{Brute Force MC}
			Not all dissimilar to the Gauss-Legendre quadrature, the brute force MC integration method takes the original integrand and churns through it by throwing random valued in using the uniform PDF. Similarly to said quadrature, we now too have limits which are not what we wish, namely $[0, 1]$, not $(-\infty, \infty)$. To deal with this, we make again a change of variables, assuming the integrand is sufficiently close to zero at $x\approx 5$ (ref. above discussion). The change of variables is then
			\begin{align}
				z_i = a + (b-a)x_i
			\end{align}
			where $a$ and $b$ are the new limits. Through any change of variables we get a Jacobi determinant, which in this case is $(b-a)^6$ since we are dealing with a 6-dimensional integral and all dimensions get the same change of variables. 
		
		
		\subsubsection{MC Integration with Importance Sampling}
			Again, we employ a change of variables to spherical coordinates resulting in eq.~\eqref{eq: integral in spherical coordinates, u, v}. We see that some values in the $u$ and $v$-directions are more likely than others, due to the exponentials e$e^{-u}$ and $e^{-v}$. This is the main idea behind importance sampling - a change of variables where we make the transition from $[0, 1]$ to $[a, b]$ making some values more likely.
			
			We are now transforming the integral as follows
			\begin{align}
				I = \int_{a}^{b} F(x) \ \d x = \int_{a}^{b} p(x) \frac{F(x)}{p(x)} \ \d x = \int_{\tilde{a}}^{\tilde{b}} \frac{F(y(x))}{p(y(x))} \ \d x
			\end{align}
			By choosing the PDF $p(u)=e^{-u}$ and $p(v)=e^{-v}$ we can omit these terms in eq.~\eqref{eq: integral in spherical coordinates, u, v}, and at the same time set the new values for $v$ and $u$ to (this is just a rewriting of $x_i=e^{-u_i}$)
			\begin{align*}
				u_i = -\ln (1 - x_i)
			\end{align*}
			and similarly for $v_i$. Note again, that the limits of this new variable is $[0, \infty)$ - just as desired! Note that since all we have done is multiply the integrand by a factor of $p(x)/p(x)=1$, no Jacobi determinant is needed.
			
		 The angular parts are just a brute force change of variables, and results in a Jacobi determinant of $4\pi^4$.
