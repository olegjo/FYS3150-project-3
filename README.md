# FYS3150-project-3
This is a numerical project in the computational physics course FYS3150 at University of Oslo, Norway. In the project I am solving the infinite six-dimensional integral needed to find the expectation value of the quantum mechanical ground state correlation energy between two electrons in the helium atom.

## File structure
The project is originally divided into 4 tasks: a), b), c) and d).
This is reflected in the structure of the following directories, however not in the final report. 

The tasks focuses on different integration methods:

Task a) Gauss-Legendre quadrature

Task b) Gauss-Laguerre quadrature

Task c) Monte Carlo integration using a "brute force" method

Task d) Monte Carlo integration using importance sampling
